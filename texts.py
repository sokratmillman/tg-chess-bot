There are two modes:
\* Playing with a friend
\* Playing with a bot

Playing with a friend:
1. To play with a friend, your friend must press the `/start` command in the bot to register
2. A friend should get his ID by writing the command `/get_my_id`
3. A friend needs to send you his ID and you can invite him to the game with the command `/start_pvp_game [FRIEND_ID]`
4. A friend needs to agree and the game will start

Playing with a bot:
It is enough to run the command `/start_ai_game` and the game with the bot will begin

How to make moves:
To make a move, write in this form _[start position][final position]_
For example, to make the central pawn move forward in the starting position, you need to write to the chat _e2e4_"""
